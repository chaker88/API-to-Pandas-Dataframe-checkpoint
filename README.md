# API-to-Pandas-Dataframe-checkpoint
In this checkpoint, we are going to practice consuming public APIs through the NASA public APIs portal.
Instructions
Go to the NASA API portal and generate your API KEY
Import the requests package and store your API KEY in variable
Go back to portal website and click on 'browse APIs'

Go through the list of the provided API endpoints once again and select 'Astronomy Picture of the Day' option. Store the results in a pandas dataframe
Do the necessary data pre-processing tasks on the previous result in order to get a clean dataframe with the following columns :
Asteroid ID
Asteroid name
The Minimal estimated diameter in Kilometre
Absolute_magnitude
Relative_velocity(km/s)
Try to export the new dataframe into a CSV file and share it with your colleagues
